# Nyxian --zh
## What is it?
Nyxian is a iOS application for iOS 16.0 and above(iOS 26 latest beta tested) that empowers iOS users to code, compile, link, sign and even execute/rapid test iOS applications directly on their device! It is the successor of the former FridaCodeManager project, which was deprecated in favor of Nyxian, because FridaCodeManager requires a jailbreak to work while Nyxian does not.
## Whats do I need?
You need a free or paid apple developer account, you have to sign Nyxian using the certificate of your apple developer account and then install it on your device and import the same certificate used for signing Nyxian it self.
## Language Support
It currently supports C, C++, ObjC and ObjC++. Its planned to add Swift support soon. It supports the entire iOS 18 SDK. All frameworks work except 3D rendering ones like SceneKIT.
## Project Support
Currently you can only make apps inside of Nyxian. Its planned to add tweak development support with ElleKIT to Nyxian.
